# betdaq-app
A application exemplifying the use of the betdaq API. Created for the Software Engineering Project at Trinity College Dublin

## Our Task
We will be rebuilding something similar to the sample application that can be run
down below. This will be done using python.

## Running the given sample application
1. Install Maven
2. Run `mvn package` in the API directory
3. Once package is built run the application using `java -cp target/demo_aapi_app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar gbe.demoaapi.app.App`
>Note that there are no values in the demoapp.properties so the application will
not run
